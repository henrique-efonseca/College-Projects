# Graphics Manipulation

This is a Java Project that I had to do to my "Introduction to Progamming" Class.
It was given to every student the same [Project Statement](https://github.com/henrique-efonseca/College-Projects/blob/master/Graphics%20Manipulation/enunciadoProjeto1920.pdf) and we had to do what asked (were also given three "default" classes: "ColorImage", "Color" and "ImageUtil").
(The project statement was given in Portuguese and I can't change it sorry.)

Briefly the project has 3 Parts and I had to create java classes to create and edit/manipulate 2D Graphics.

**Grade: A** (scale A-D)



## Part 1

**Objective**: Develop a static class with procedures and functions for creating and manipulating color images (ColorImage) representative of graphics.

This class has procedures and functions to: create a 2D Column Graphic; apply a gradient to the 2D Column Graphic; create a 2D Scatter Plot Graphic; rotate 90ยบ degrees an Image.

## Part 2

**Objective**: Develop a Class of Objects that represents the concept of graphic.

After the creation of an object of this class it should be possible to: add/modify the Graphic's Title; add/modify the Graphic's Horizontal Axis; add/modify the Graphic's Vertical Axis; set the graphic to transparent on Even-column and odd-line pixels or Odd column and even line; get all the information associated to the graphic.

## Part 3

**Objective**: Develop a class of objects that allow overlapping graphics.

After the creation of an object of this class it should be possible to: store a stack of graphics; add a graphic to the top of the stack; remove a graphic from the top of the stack; add a graphic to an index of the stack; given two indexs swap position two graphics of the stack; get every graphic without title; order alphabetically every graphic of the stack; get the resulting image from the overlap of every graphic from the stack; rotate 90ยบ degrees the previous image.
