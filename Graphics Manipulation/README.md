# Graphics Manipulation

This is a Java Project that I had to do to my "Introduction to Progamming" Class.
It was given to every student the same project statement and we had to do what asked (were also given three "default" classes: "ColorImage", "Color" and "ImageUtil").
(The project statement was given in Portuguese and I can't change it sorry.)

Briefly the project has 3 Parts and I had to create java classes to create and edit/manipulate 2D Graphics.

Grade: A (scale A-D)

## Part 1

**Objective**: Develop a static class with procedures and functions for creating and manipulating color images (ColorImage) representative of graphics.

This class has procedures and functions to: create a 2D Column Graphic; apply a gradient to the 2D Column Graphic; create a 2D Scatter Plot Graphic; rotate an Image
