# Percolation

This ia a ___Java Project___ pair work that I had to do to my "**Algorithms & Data Structures**" class.
The project is called [Percolation](https://github.com/henrique-efonseca/College-Projects/blob/master/Percolation/Percolation.pdf) and it is adapted from the [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1?) online course - by Princeton University - from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).


For this project I had to submit two classes: [Percolation](https://github.com/henrique-efonseca/College-Projects/blob/master/Percolation/Percolation.java) and [PercolationStats](https://github.com/henrique-efonseca/College-Projects/blob/master/Percolation/PercolationStats.java).
