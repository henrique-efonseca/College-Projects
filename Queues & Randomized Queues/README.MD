# Queues & Randomized Queues

This ia a ___Java Project___ that I had to do to my "**Algorithms & Data Structures**" class. <br>
The project is called [Queues & Randomized Queues](https://github.com/henrique-efonseca/College-Projects/blob/master/Queues%20%26%20Randomized%20Queues/Queues%20%26%20Randomized%20Queues%20-%20Assignment.pdf) and it is adapted from the [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1?) online course - by Princeton University - from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).


For this project I had to submit three classes: [RandomizedQueue](), [Deque]() and [Permutation]().

## Dequeue
Princeton Algorithm Programming Assignment 2
 Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators. <br>
Website - [Queues & Randomized Queues](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php)

Dequeue. A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. Create a generic data type Deque that implements the following API:

```java
    public class Deque<Item> implements Iterable<Item> {
     
    // construct an empty deque
    public Deque() 
    
    // is the deque empty?
    public boolean isEmpty()         
    
    // return the number of items on the deque
    public int size() 
    
    // add the item to the front
    public void addFirst(Item item)     
    
    // add the item to the end
    public void addLast(Item item)      
    
    // remove and return the item from the front
    public Item removeFirst()      
    
    // remove and return the item from the end
    public Item removeLast()          
    
    // return an iterator over items in order from front to end
    public Iterator<Item> iterator()   
    
    // unit testing (required)
    public static void main(String[] args)  
}
```

Corner cases.  Throw the specified exception for the following corner cases:

Throw a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if the client calls either addFirst() or addLast() with a null argument.
Throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls either removeFirst() or removeLast when the deque is empty.
Throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls the next() method in the iterator when there are no more items to return.
Throw a java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the client calls the remove() method in the iterator. 

Performance requirements.  Your deque implementation must support each deque operation (including construction) in constant worst-case time. A deque containing n items must use at most 48n + 192 bytes of memory and use space proportional to the number of items currently in the deque. Additionally, your iterator implementation must support each operation (including construction) in constant worst-case time.

<br>

## Randomized Queue
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure. Create a generic data type RandomizedQueue that implements the following API:

```java
public class RandomizedQueue<Item> implements Iterable<Item> {

    // construct an empty randomized queue
    public RandomizedQueue()        
    
    // is the randomized queue empty?
    public boolean isEmpty()    
    
    // return the number of items on the randomized queue
    public int size()  
    
    // add the item
    public void enqueue(Item item)          
    
    // remove and return a random item
    public Item dequeue()   
    
    // return a random item (but do not remove it)
    public Item sample()                 
    
    // return an independent iterator over items in random order
    public Iterator<Item> iterator()    
    
    // unit testing (required)
    public static void main(String[] args)  
}
```

Iterator.  Each iterator must return the items in uniformly random order. The order of two or more iterators to the same randomized queue must be mutually independent; each iterator must maintain its own random order.

Corner cases.  Throw the specified exception for the following corner cases:
Throw a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if the client calls enqueue() with a null argument.
Throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls either sample() or dequeue() when the randomized queue is empty.
Throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls the next() method in the iterator when there are no more items to return.
Throw a java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the client calls the remove() method in the iterator. 

Performance requirements.  Your randomized queue implementation must support each randomized queue operation (besides creating an iterator) in constant amortized time. That is, any sequence of m randomized queue operations (starting from an empty queue) must take at most cm steps in the worst case, for some constant c. A randomized queue containing n items must use at most 48n + 192 bytes of memory. Additionally, your iterator implementation must support operations next() and hasNext() in constant worst-case time; and construction in linear time; you may (and will need to) use a linear amount of extra memory per iterator.

## Client
Write a client program Permutation.java that takes an integer k as a command-line argument; reads in a sequence of strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints exactly k of them, uniformly at random. Print each item from the sequence at most once.

    % more distinct.txt                        % more duplicates.txt
    A B C D E F G H I                          AA BB BB BB BB BB CC CC

    % java-algs4 Permutation 3 < distinct.txt   % java-algs4 Permutation 8 < duplicates.txt
    C                                               BB
    G                                               AA
    A                                               BB
                                                    CC
    % java-algs4 Permutation 3 < distinct.txt       BB
    E                                               BB
    F                                               CC
    G                                               BB

Your program must implement the following API:

```java
public class Permutation {
    public static void main(String[] args)
}
```

Command-line input.  You may assume that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, where n is the number of string on standard input.

Performance requirements.  The running time of Permutation must be linear in the size of the input. You may use only a constant amount of memory plus either one Deque or RandomizedQueue object of maximum size at most n. (For an extra challenge, use only one Deque or RandomizedQueue object of maximum size at most k.)
