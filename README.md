# College Projects

Hello! My name is **Henrique Fonseca** and I'm proud to be a **Telecommunications and Computer Engineering** student at [Iscte - Instituto Universitário de Lisboa](https://www.iscte-iul.pt).

Here I will keep track of the projects that I have done for some courses that demand so.
Because I'm studying at Portugal some descriptions/projects/reports may be in Portuguese because so it is requested, but I will translate every thing that I can (and that I'm allowed) to English.
