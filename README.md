# College Projects

Hello! My name is **Henrique Fonseca** and I'm proud to be a student of **Telecommunications and Computer Engineering** at [ISCTE](https://www.iscte-iul.pt).

Here I will keep track of the projects that I have (and will have) done for some classes that demand so.
Because I'm studying at Portugal some descriptions/projects/reports may be in Portuguese, because so it is requested, but I will translate every thing that I can (and that I'm allowed) to English.
